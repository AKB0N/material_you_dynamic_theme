## 0.0.2
* Fixes INFO: `renderView` is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Consider using `RendererBinding.renderViews` instead as the binding may manage multiple RenderViews. This feature was deprecated after v3.10.0-12.0.pre.
* All of the package dependencies are supported in the latest version.


## 0.0.1
* Open beta release of the `Material You Dynamic Theme` plugin.
  Please see the [README](https://github.com/AKB0N/material_you_dynamic_theme/blob/main/README.md) for updated integration steps.
